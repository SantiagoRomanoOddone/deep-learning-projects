# deep-learning-projects

Welcome to my deep learning projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my projects related to deep learning.

# Contents: 
 - Project 1: pythorch-introduction: In this project, I experimented with building different neural network architectures using PyTorch. I analyzed the results and explored methods to improve the performance of the models.

 - Project 2:  convolutional-neural-networks-for-image-classification: In this notebook, I trained a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. I compared the accuracy achieved by both models and provided insights into why they perform differently. For the CNN, I analyzed architecture parameters like kernel size, padding, and stride, and tracked the size of feature maps as they move through the network.
